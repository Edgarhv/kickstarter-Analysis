  # Kickstarting with Excel
  Excel helps in a better analysis of the Kickstarter campaign using tables and graphs to give Louise essential information at first glance. Visualizations help discover a link or trend within a dataset but represent the findings in a simple and easy-to-use way.
  
  ## Overview of Project
  It's using Excel to help Louise understand the specific factors that make a project campaign successful. Also, this will help Louise to make decisions.
  
### Purpose
In this project, Louise has been visually analyzed to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Feedback will also be provided to Louise to help her set a realistic goal, timeline, and location for her Kickstarter campaign, so her next play  "Fever" will be successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
To determine if other Kickstarter campaigns were able to get closer to their fundraising goals in a short period of time, two graphs were analyzed:
   
    1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date.
    2. Outcomes Based on Goals. 
    
 The line graphs below tell us a few important factors that will help Louise in her campaigning.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the data analysis of the results based on the launch dates, it is observed that most of the successful campaigns were launched in May and June. We would assume that these months are summer, and people support the campaigns, but we need more data to give a better analysis. On the other hand, in December the chances of success and failure were the same.

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
It can be seen that from the results data, campaigns with a target amount of more than $ 45,000 are more likely to fail. Campaigns with a target amount between $ 10,000 and $ 25,000 have a 50 percent chance of success or failure. It is also observed that the higher the goal, the higher the chances of failure.


## Results

The length of the campaign and its' launch date do play an important role in campaign success.
 
  -May and June are the best months to launch
  
  -December is the worst month to launch
  
  -In general the higher the goal the higher the failure rate. 
  
 ### What are some limitations of this dataset?
 
 There are other factors of analysis, it is necessary to include other factors in the data set for future funders. Since the target amount and the month of the year may not be enough for a more complicated project.
